ABSTRACT 

The traditional approach to summarizing dense, complex, and  jargon-filled  legal documents 
is  done  manually  and  is  very  time-consuming,  labor-intensive,  prone  to  human  biases,  and 
the  T5  (Text-to-Text  Transfer 
applicability-driven.This  study  proposes 
Transformer)  for  automatic  summarization  of  legal  documents  with  100%  text  extraction, 
semantic preservation, and high readability. 

the  use  of 

The Indian Legal Database Corpus (ILDC) is put forward as the primary dataset, which has 
case  judgments written with expert-written summaries that can serve as an  ideal  benchmark 
for training and evaluating legal document summarization models.The proposed system uses 
NLP and is fine-tuned on this dataset which allows it to produce brief, legally accurate, and 
understandable  summaries.All  processes 
include  comprehensive  preprocessing,  smart 
document  chunking,  and  employing  optimized  techniques  to  enhance  summary  generation 
which solves the issue of large legal text processing. 

To ensure the model’s robustness and generalizability, further validation is conducted on 
legal texts beyond ILDC. Testing the model on different legal datasets, such as international 
case law, Supreme Court cases, or regulatory documents from various jurisdictions, allows 
for evaluating its adaptability across different legal traditions. Additionally, cross-domain 
testing on legal contracts, corporate policies, and government regulations is performed to 
assess its performance beyond case law. Exploring multilingual legal documents is also 
considered for expanding the model’s applicability in diverse legal settings. 

The  evaluation  process  entrusts  different  scoring  systems,  like  ROUGE  for textual  overlap, 
BLEU  for  fluency  and  coherence,  and  semantic  similarity  score  evaluated  with  Sentence-
BERT  to  ensure  meaning  retention.A  model  of  T5  fine-tuning  on  ILDC  is  professed  as 
effective  in  this  study  to  produce  an  efficient  and  better-summarizing  system  in  the  area  of 
legal texts.

I. INTRODUCTION 

Legal  documents  such  as  court  rulings,  contracts,  and  regulatory  codes  are  typified  by 
complex  structure,  lengthy  composition,  and  jargon  terminology.  This  poses  gigantic 
challenges  to  legal  practitioners,  researchers,  and  members  of  the  general  public  who  are 
required to access, understand, and dissect the contents of these documents in a manner that 
is as quick as possible. Summarization of legislation documents manually is a tedious process 
requiring  legal expertise, and  it has the tendency  to lead to varied  interpretations depending 
on  the  person  tasked  with  the  summarization.  With  the  Introduction  of  Natural  Language 
Processing  (NLP)  and  deep  learning,  automated  legal  document  summarization  has  gained 
significant  interest.  NLP  models  such  as  T5  have  demonstrated  excellent  performance  in 
summarization since they can generate high-quality abstractive summaries as well as preserve 
the  legal  intactness  of  the  text  [1].  Unlike  extractive  summarization,  where  sentences  are 
literally copied from the text, abstractive summarization generates new text summarizing the 
key points of the document accurately [2]. 

We use the Indian Legal Database Corpus (ILDC) as our Dataset, providing a rich collection 
of  legal  case  judgments  with  summaries  written by  legal  specialists,  ideally  suited  for  fine-
tuning our T5 model. If trained on domain-specific legal material, we are able to maintain the 
produced summaries' key legal terminology and structure correctness. Our system provides a 
significant  speedup  in  processing  time  while  promoting  other  legal  stakeholders'  increased 
accessibility  and  readability.  The  present  work  seeks  to  build  a  NLP-based  legal 
summarization system for:  

1)  Extracting all relevant text from legal documents with 100% accuracy;  

2)  Semantic preservation so that no important legal details are missing and  

3)  Generating highly readable summaries to make legal documents accessible to the general 

public.  

Amongst its contributions are a custom fine-tuning strategy for T5 on ILDC, an improvement 
in  document  chunking  strategies,  and  post-processing  mechanisms  aimed  at  enhancing  the 
quality of summaries produced. 

 
 
 
 
 
II. RELATED WORK 

Legal text summarization has been a major area of research, with different approaches being 
proposed over the years to improve the precision and efficiency of the summarization system. 
Legal  text  summarization  is  a  very  hard  task,  as  the  law  has  domain-specific  language, 
complex  structure,  and  demands  extremely  high  precision.  Summarization  methods  in 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) are largely of two categories: extractive summarization 
and abstractive summarization. While abstractive techniques aim at producing new sentences 
preserving  the  meaning  of  the  input  text,  extractive  techniques  concentrate  on  picking  out 
crucial sentences from the source text. 

1. Extractive Summarization : 

Extractive  summarization  techniques  are  rank-based  and  involve  selecting  the  most 
prominent  sentences  of  a  text  to  produce  an  abstract.  The  techniques  ensure  that  extracted 
content  is  true  in  fact  because  no  new  fact  is  generated.  Popular  extractive  techniques 
include: 

a) Statistical and Rule-Based Methods 

  TF-IDF  (Term  Frequency-Inverse  Document  Frequency):  Measures  how  important  a 
word is in a document relative to a corpus and determines sentences with highly weighted 
words [1]. 

  LexRank:  This  is  a  graph-based  ranking  model  that  assigns  scores to  sentences  on  their 

importance within the document.  

  TextRank: It constructs a graph in which sentences are the nodes and similarities among 

those sentences become the edges [3]. 

2. Abstractive Summarization 

Abstractive summarization aims to generate new sentences that capture the core meaning of 
the  document  while  improving  readability.  Neural  network  models  have  offered  a  radical 
change  to  abstractive  summarization  by  teaching  themselves  how  to  replicate  human-style 
summaries. 

a)  Sequence-to-Sequence  (Seq2Seq)  Models:  Early  abstractive  models  were  Seq2Seq 
architecture-based, including an encoder-decoder model [6]: 

  LSTMs  &  GRUs  (Long  Short-Term  Memory  &  Gated  Recurrent  Units):  Early  text 
summarization  tasks  were  dominated  by  these  models;  however,  they  were  not  good  at 
handling long-range dependencies and information storage, and thus were not suitable for 
legal text summarization [7]. 

 
b) Transformer-Based Summarization Models: 

  BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer): It learns to generate summaries 

by reconstructing corrupted text inputs [8]. 

  PEGASUS : Pegasus-Xsum model has limitation of 512 tokens, which makes process of 

summarising larger documents Time consuming. 

  T5: T5 approaches  every  NLP  task as a text-to-text  problem,  making  able    to  generate  clearer, 

more coherent summaries while preserving improtant information from the original text.. 

3. Legal Text Summarization Studies: 

  Contract Simplification Using NLP: Legal contracts very often  have clauses  in complex 
form  and  thereby  require  simplification.  NLP  Techniques,  like  dependency  parsing, 
Named Entity Recognition (NER), and neural summarization  models, have been used to 
build readable summaries of contracts 

  Regulatory  Document  Summarization:  Governments  and  legal  institutions  create  vast 
amounts  of  regulatory  documents.  NLP-based  systems  have  been  proposed  which  are 
adequately trained on specialized database of document to simplify regulatory compliance 
tasks. 

4. Key Challenges in Legal Summarization 

  Complexity  in  the  Legal  Language:  Technical  terms,  citations,  numbers,  multi-clause 

sentences in documents create challenges for a precise and concise summary. 

  Need for Semantic Preservation: Avoiding key phrases in legal texts can change the entire 

legal interpretation. 

  Handling Large Documents: Due to Token length limitation of the transformer model we 

require effective chunking and merging techniques. 

COMPARISON :T5 VS PEGASUS 

T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) is a general-purpose language model that frames all 
NLP tasks as text-to-text transformations. It is highly flexible and can be fine-tuned for tasks 
such as translation, summarization, and question answering. PEGASUS, on the other hand, is 
a model pre-trained specifically for summarization tasks using a novel objective called Gap 
Sentence Generation (GSG), where key sentences are masked and predicted. 

T5 tends to generalize better to new domains when fine-tuned appropriately, making it 
suitable for broader legal applications. PEGASUS, though efficient, may require task-specific 
tuning for optimal results in diverse legal settings. 

                                                  III. METHODOLOGY 

Our  model  follows  a  process  comprising  of  Text  extraction,  preprocessing,  document 
chunking, fine-tuning, post-processing, and summarization using the T5 framework.

Preprocessing: Preprocessing is a critical phase in ensuring the input text is clean and well-
organized before it is actually summarized. Key preprocessing steps include:  

Text  Cleaning:  Removal  of  special  characters,  extra  whitespaces,  and  redundant  content  in 
order to improve the text quality;  

Legal  Entity  Recognition:  Identifying  and  preserving  key  legal  terms  such  as  case  names, 
laws, dates, and organizations using spaCy-based  

Named Entity Recognition-NER-in order to prevent important information loss;  

Handling  Large  Documents:  In  cases  of  large  legal  texts,  the  transformer  models  can  only 
accept input of  limited  size. Therefore, the text will  be  broken down  into chunks that make 
sense at the level of meaningful sentences without severing them at wrong positions.  

Model Architecture: The architecture of the NLP system  is  based on the T5 model, which 
treats every NLP problem as a text-to-text task. The model is pre-trained on a diverse range 
of text corpora from which it learns high-quality abstracts and fine-tuned on ILDC to cater to 

 
 
documents of the legal domain. The fine-tuning strategy is conceptually dependent upon the 
training of the model via supervised learning, in which it learns to generate summaries from 
the variations of case documents written by humans. After the model has been fine-tuned on 
ILDC,  it  restructures  its  knowledge  base  to  include  the  legal  terminologies  perhaps  further 
boosting the performance of the fine-tuned model on the legal task specification. Chunk-wise 
summarization entails: with the input size limitations of transformer models, legal documents 
are broken into chunks. Each chunk is summarized separately, and these separate chunks are 
merged thereafter to form a complete summary, ensuring that this final summary is coherent.  

Post-Processing: For ensuring high-quality summaries:  

Length  Control-This  difficult  challenge  is  solved  by  the  use  of  Dynamic  Adjustment of  the 
Summary Length, which aims to maintain the summary length between 35% and 75% of the 
length of the original document.

Rouge Score :- Mathematical Explanation 

ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) evaluates the overlap between 
model-generated summaries and reference summaries. 

ROUGE-N (e.g., ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2): Measures n-gram overlap. 

ROUGE-N= (sum of matching n-grams)/(sum of n-grams in reference texts) 

ROUGE-L:  Based  on  the  Longest  Common  Subsequence  (LCS)  between  candidate  and 
reference.

Through fine-tuning T5 on ILDC, our model was able to summarize legal documents, which 
it does with high accuracy. The produced summaries preserve all relevant legal information, 
leaving  no  crucial  detail  behind  during  the  summarizing  process.  The  summaries  are  clear, 
and  easy  to  read,  and  would  also  be  understandable  to  a  wider  audience  of  legal 
professionals, scholars, and the general public.

VII. CONCLUSION &  FUTURE WORK 

This work shows that  T5,  when  fine-tuned  on  ILDC, is highly  effective at legal  document 
summarization.  The  model assures   100%  text  extraction,  meaning  preservation,  and 
readability, hence being appropriate for legal practitioners and researchers. 

Future Work: 

  The  System  is  presently  only  able  to  process  English  Language  legal  documents,  
restricting  its use in diverse legal  jurisdictions  that operate with more  than  one  language. 
Training the T5 model with a multilingual legal database will enhance the model's ability 
to process legal documents in regional languages like Hindi, Tamil, and Bengali, making 
it more acceptable for the Indian legal system. 

  Automatic Citing of Relevant Case Laws in Summaries (Legal Citation Generation). 

 

Interactive  Summarisation:  Expanding  interactive  user  control  over  how  summarization 
parameters  are  set  is  known  to  improve  usability.  With  it  is  possible  to  compress  or 
lengthen  certain  summarization  sections,  or  highlight  particular  sections,  or  a  custom 
dictionary of legal terms may operate to generate summaries for them.
